                            <h4>Galle, Sri Lanka</h4>
                            <p>
                                Philippus Baldaeus, a Dutch minister who served
                                in the area in the late 1650s, detailed his
                                observations of Galle Harbour, in his work,
                                Description of the East India, Malabar and
                                Coromandel Coasts, stating that there was an
                                iron cannon placed on the ramparts and a lantern
                                to guide the sailors on top of the 28 feet above
                                sea level rock which jutted out into the sea.
                                The first lighthouse at Galle was built by the
                                British in 1848. It was a 24.4-metre-high (80
                                ft) iron lighthouse, constructed from cast-iron
                                plates, imported from England, designed by
                                British architect Alexander Gordon and erected
                                by Messrs. Robinson, Engineers of Pimlico. The
                                lighthouse, painted white, was located on the
                                southwest bastion, Utrtecht Bastion, of Galle
                                fort on the western side of Galle Harbor. It had
                                a fixed point light with prolate reflectors,
                                which was visible for 19 kilometres (12 mi). In
                                July 1936 it was destroyed by fire. The current
                                26.5-metre-high (87 ft) concrete lighthouse was
                                erected about 100 metres (330 ft) from the
                                original site....

                                The Cape Bolinao Lighthouse is a historic
                                lighthouse in Bolinao, Pangasinan, Philippines.
                                It was built in 1905 by a trio of American,
                                British and Filipino engineers. Situated at an
                                elevation of 107 meters (351 ft) above sea
                                level, it is the second highest lighthouse in
                                the Philippines next to the Cape Bojeador
                                Lighthouse. The lighthouse tower itself stands
                                30.78 meters (101.0 ft) high. The original third

                                was made in England with the lantern sourced
                                from France. The apparatus of the lighthouse was
                                replaced by a close replica by Filipino
                                mechanics. Until the 1980s, The lighthouse

                                Fort Aguada, constructed in 1612, was the most
                                prized and crucial fort of Portuguese
                                overlooking the Arabian Sea. Built on the mouth
                                of river Mandovi, it was strategically located
                                and was the chief defence of Portuguese against
                                the Dutch and Marathas. The fort is so large
                                that it envelops the entire peninsula at the
                                southwestern tip of Bardez. It was a reference

                                time. A freshwater spring within the fort
                                provided water supply to the ships that used to
                                stop by. This is how the fort got its name:

                                The Lighthouse, known as a Stevenson Tower, was
                                built by Robert Stevenson. It took two years to
                                build; work commenced in 1828 and the Lighthouse
                                was first lit on 26th March 1830. The tower
                                stands 26 metres high and the light is 99 metres
                                above sea level. On a clear night, the light
                                could be seen 28 nautical miles (32 land miles)
                                away with a flashing white light every 20
                                seconds. Until 1971, the lens was a combination
                                of shining brass and sparkling crystal, turning
                                through its two and three quarter minute
                                revolution on beautifully made rollers â€“ so
                                perfect that the five tons of lens could be
                                moved by hand. The lamp was as simple as the
                                familiar tilly-lamp, lit by hand with paraffin
                                and then pumped up, for all the world like a
                                camp cooking stove. There, however, the
                                resemblance ended, for the surrounding prisms,
                                which gave off myriad rainbows on a sunny day,
                                caught the light and magnified it to the power
                                of 29,000 candles.....

                                southernmost cape of Istria - Kamenjak. It was
                                built on the middle of the islet in shape of a

                                The 1873 tower is tapered in a style
                                characteristic of Anglesey windmills. It is 33
                                feet (10 m) high and 18 feet (5.5 m) in
                                diameter. It may have been constructed by an

                                the tower itself was originally used as a

                                tower". The north-east door is flanked by small
                                windows, and the two floors above also have
                                small windows, but the top does not. The conical
                                roof is slated and has a flagpole. The present
                                lantern window is about 6 feet 6 inches (1.98 m)
                                by 2 feet (0.61 m). The optic, silver-plated
                                reflector and Fresnel lens are dated 1861 and
                                were used into the 1970s. The lantern was
                                originally lit by six Argand lamps with
                                reflectors....

                            <h3>Kallur Lighthouse</h3>
                            <h4>Wild Island of Kalsoy, Faroe Islands</h4>
                            <p>
                                The Faroese island of Kalsoy, with its
                                candy-striped lighthouse perched precariously
                                over raging seas in the shadow of a towering
                                promontory, is definitely one of the iconic
                                images that put the Faroes on the map of many a
                                traveller (ourselves included). All soaring
                                peaks, dramatic sheer cliffs, wild beauty, and
                                cosy little villages, this far-flung corner of
                                the world is almost too picturesque to believe.
                                In fact, Kalsoy is so picture-perfect that itâ€™s
                                about to find new stardom as a filming location
                                in the James Bond film â€˜No Time to Dieâ€™.
                                Honestly, the day we spent on Kalsoy, hiking to
                                the Kallur Lighthouse and exploring the cute
                                town of Mikladalur was one of those â€˜pinch-meâ€™
                                travel days; the ones where you canâ€™t quite
                                believe that youâ€™re actually, really, finally
                                here....
