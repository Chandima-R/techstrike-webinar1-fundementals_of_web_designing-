                            <p>
                                Perched on a cliff on the central California
                                coast, 50 miles south of San Francisco, the
                                115-foot Pigeon Point Lighthouse, one of the
                                tallest lighthouses in America, has been guiding
                                mariners since 1872. Its five-wick lard oil
                                lamp, and first-order Fresnel lens, comprised of
                                1,008 prisms, was first lit at sunset, November
                                15, 1872. The lens stands 16 feet tall, 6 feet
                                in diameter, and weighs 2,000 pounds. Now on
                                display in the fog signal building, it sat in a
                                lantern room constructed at the Lighthouse
                                Service's general depot in New York before being
                                shipped around the Horn. Although the original
                                Fresnel lens is no longer in use, the lighthouse
                                is still an active U.S. Coast Guard aid to
                                navigation using an automated LED beacon.

                                Perched on a cliff on the central California

                                115-foot Pigeon Point Lighthouse, one of the
                                tallest lighthouses in America, has been guiding
                                mariners since 1872. Its five-wick lard oil
                                lamp, and first-order Fresnel lens, comprised of
                                1,008 prisms, was first lit at sunset, November
                                15, 1872. The lens stands 16 feet tall, 6 feet
                                in diameter, and weighs 2,000 pounds. Now on
                                display in the fog signal building, it sat in a
                                lantern room constructed at the Lighthouse
